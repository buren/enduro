You can then either choose to abort or ignore the failing tests and commit anyway. \r\n    \r\n    \r\n## Continuous integration\r\n\r\nAfter ```gs done``` is done the project will be sent to Travis CI, which will then build the project and run its entire test suite.\r\n\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!

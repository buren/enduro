You can then either choose to abort or ignore failing tests and commit anyway.\r\n    \r\n    \r\n## Continuous integration\r\n\r\nAfter ```gs done``` is done the project will be sent to Travis CI, which will then build the project and run its entire test suite.

The structure that it uses is the following:\r\nMain: Where your programcode is placed.\r\nTest: Where your testcode is placed.\r\nTarget: When maven builds your project it is placed in the Target folder.\r\n\r\n\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
